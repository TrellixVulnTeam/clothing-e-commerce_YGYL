This is a React project to represent a full e-commerce clothing shopping. The application displays a collection of clothes divided by category that allows the user to preview the first 4 items of each category. The user can add or remove items to the cart, sign in and sign out, and pay for the items on the checkout page (using a test card provided in the application).

User authentication
* The application uses google firebase to authenticate and store user data

Storage
* User authentication is stored in google firebase
* It uses Redux-persist to store cart items localy during navigation even if the page is refreshed
* The application fetches data using promise object and Async Await functionality

Performance
* Users are able to quickly navigate between pages through Router and Switch from React-router-dom
* The application makes use of Selectors (Memoization technic to cache and avoid unecessary rendering)

Scalability
* The application is well divided into various components to make it reusable and scalable-proof
* The application makes use of Redux to manage the state and mitigate complexity and allow future scalability

Payment
* The application uses Stripe API interface to allow payments (test card is provided and no real payment is performed in this project)


Future updates **
* Future versions will implement GrapthQL and integrade backend *
* Implement React Hooks instead of Redux
* Create the contact page


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
